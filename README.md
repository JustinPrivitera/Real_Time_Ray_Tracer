# final_project_csc572
final project for csc 572, graduate graphics

use WASD, space, and left shift to move
QEZC to rotate
P to toggle scene... don't ever do this
F to toggle aspect ratio

now the only lighting available is ray traced ambient occlusion
it supports real time reflections and realistic shadowing
